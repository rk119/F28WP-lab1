The International Civil Aviation Organisation has a standard set of words
use when one wishes to spell out a word.  They are designed to be readily 
distinguishable so that there is no doubt whether the speaker 
meant `EM' or `EN'  (probably the most similar letters in English).
Here they are jumbled up, so that you need to sort them out!
